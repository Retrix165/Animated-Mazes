# Animated-Mazes
Animation of popular pathfinding algorithms using PyGame by Reid Smith


## Algorithms Animated
- A* _(A-Star)_
- BFS _(Breadth First Search)_
- DFS _(Depth First Search)_

## Outline of Code
A brief description of how the animation and algorithms run

1. User parameters such as animation window size, alorithm choice, whether to show statistics, etc. are input
2. Chosen algorithm runs and sends copy of maze (graph) state at each algorithm step to a buffer
3. PyGame displays the buffer to animate

## Use

Animated-Mazes can be utilized to both visualize how the different algorithms search to comprehend them in a greater manner as well as display statistics of comparison such as final path length and step count in order to facilitate algorithm performance comparison.
